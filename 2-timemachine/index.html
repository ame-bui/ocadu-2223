                    The Vietnamese call the Vietnam–America conflict the American War (1960–75) partly to distinguish it from the previous ‘‘French War,’’ in a similar way that the Vietnam War (1965–75) is referenced to the war before it in Korea (1950–53) in the history of the cold war. According to Marilyn Young, Americans remember the Vietnam War mainly as a conflict that happened among Americans:<br>‘‘The Vietnam war, in short, was a civil war, but - and this may puzzle Vietnamese, who are currently discovering the extent to which it was a civil war for them - it was an American civil war.’’ The radical division of a nation as to the objective and the conduct of a war that it is drawn to fight, as Powell notes, has a lot to do with how the memory of this war turns into a ‘‘collective phan-tom.’’Young states, <br>

                    According to another observer, the war was waged ‘‘not only on a distant battlefield, but also ‘in the uncharted depths of the American psyche and in the obscurity of our nation’s soul’. ’’ Young points out also that the Vietnamese, a generation after the war formally ended, are now discov-ering the hitherto unspoken dimension of what has been, in the official discourse, an unambiguous, uncontested struggle of the unified nation against foreign aggression. Following Young, we will see in the following chapters how the recovered civil war dimension of the American War generates an array of interpretative controversies at community level and how these controversies structure some of the ghost narratives told within the community.

                    The phenomenon of war ghosts is intimately connected, in both Vietnam and America, with the troubled memory of the war. On this matter, Young’s idea that the Vietnam War and the American War were both partly a civil war is worth careful consideration. One must not forget, however, the fact that death in this doubly civil war took place mainly in the land of Vietnam and that it is the Vietnamese who count the vast majority in the list of the war dead. This simple truth must have some relevance in the stories of war ghosts told in Vietnam and in their being distinct from the idiom of ghost mentioned in American public media. France experienced a proliferation of war ghost narratives in the after-math of the First World War, according to the historian Jay Winter in his moving work on the role of ghost beliefs in mass grieving, but the nation’s foreign military ventures in Algeria or Indochina have never produced any remotely comparable corpus of stories in France. It is rather in Vietnam, not in France, that some of France’s ancients combat-tants are still half-alive today in the form of a giant, uniformed ghost or in other less intimidating forms of spectral existence. Some of these old ghosts appear in company with those of other racial origins from the time of the French War, whom the locals identity as the colonial con-scripts from Algeria or Morocco. This finding applies to American history too. Of the several wars America fought for self-defense or in defense of other nations, no history of war can compete with that of the American Civil War in terms of contribution to the American folkloric and literary tradition of ghost stories. War in my home and war in their home seem to be two quite different historical grounds for this particular genre of cultural production.

                    Death in Vietnam was mainly the death of a soldier in American memory, as evidenced by the central material symbol of this collective memory – the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Arlington, Virginia. Death in the American War was also mainly that of a combatant according to official Vietnamese memorial art. This is materialized in the numerous cemeteries and cenotaphs distributed widely throughout Vietnam that can be easily seen in any rural village or town district. In reality, however, death in the Vietnam–American War was virtually anyone’s death for the Vietnamese – young and old, male and female, combatant or non-combatant, partisan or non-partisan, or communist or anticommunist. This was particularly the case in the southern and central regions of Vietnam where the frontiers of battlefield were abominably unclear.

                    The war against America was theoretically a ‘‘people’s war.’’ It aimed to consolidate the army with the people, the soldiers in combat uniforms with the patriotic citizens without uniform, and the combat units with the rural villages. The army was the fish, according to a powerful metaphor of the Vietnamese revolutionary war, and the people were the water where the fish would live. In many villages of southern and central Vietnam, the unity of army and people was far more complex and turbulent than the idyllic image of fish swimming peacefully in the landscaped pond of a middle-class Vietnamese town house. As the conflict escalated, the ‘‘water’’ was systematically pumped out to expose the ‘‘fish.’’ Often, no ‘‘fish’’ were found in the bottom of the pond, and this frequently led to tragic incidents of civilian killing. The dislocated water of people could not survive away from their ancestral land and was also pushed back to their place of origin to harbor the fish of army. The agit-prop activity to encourage war refugees to return to their homeland was intense through-out the refugee camps and strategic hamlets in southern and central Vietnam. As a former highlands tribal leader said, ‘‘We were between the hammer and anvil. The Communists tried to resettle us ... The Americans wanted to get free fire zones with the Montagnards.’’ Moving hazardously between the rural homeland and the refugee camp or the urban slum, people in the people’s war left numerous traces of loss and trails of sorrow. Today, shallow graves and collective tombs remain in the sand dune, along the village footpath, and in the household garden; unknown human remains are discovered underneath the mud floor of the house. Some of these improperly buried dead belonged to the revolu-tionary side, others to the opposite side, and many more to both-and-neither sides. Some of them would belong to soldiers, but these are greatly outnumbered by the remains of the dead who had no war-related pro-fessional backgrounds.

                    It is in this historical landscape of generalized violence and mass dis-placement that people perceive today the presence of grievous ghosts of war. The destruction of war constitutes the backdrop or what archeol-ogists call ‘‘the contemporary past’’ for the phenomenon of war ghosts. Against the background of a mass-mobilized total war with heavy foreign intervention, war ghosts in Vietnam are highly diverse in origin and sometimes have a cosmopolitan outlook. In his short story ‘‘The billion dollar skeleton,’’ Phan Huy Dong lists, ‘‘men women children old people Viets Laos Khmers Thais Koreans Australians New Zealanders French black white red yellow brown ... even a few Americans.’’ Many Vietnamese regularly burn incense and pray on behalf of these heteroge-neous beings, and these people are from all walks of life; many with the biographical background of marching in ‘‘the trail of revolution’’ (duong cach mang). Those who refuse to acknowledge the existence of sorrowful war ghosts in the old fields of mass death are sometimes mocked and subtly criticized – subtly because many of these non-conformists tend to be in positions of power in the Communist Party and other key political organizations.

                    These heterogeneous ghosts of war do not constitute a ‘‘collective phantom.’’ They are not merely an allegorical device for historical anal-ogy, invoked to deliver the meaning of a new historical event against the similar or contrasting background of a familiar old one. Nor do they merely point to the paradox in modern historical consciousness, addressed by Schmitt, that a dead era appears to walk in the new era at a time of crisis and especially if the new era nurtures an ideology of radical break with the old. This paradox is deeply engrained in the tradition of modern social thought. Karl Marx wrote bitterly in The eighteenth brum-aire of the ghost of dead generations exercising its invisible hands in the social revolution and thereby distorting its course, whereas Max Weber wrote The protestant ethic in terms of how the tradition of medieval monastic asceticism prowls the culture of modern capitalist economic order. Drawing upon this intellectual legacy, Mark Schneider argues that apparitions persist in the modern world despite the rise of science, and that their enduring existence is often unrecognized in modern societies because its domain of existence has changed from the natural to the symbolic.

                    Ghosts in Vietnam are not ‘‘modern’’ in the above sense and in that their existence is perceived to be a ‘‘natural’’ phenomenon rather than a cultural symbol. There are people in Vietnam who would view the exis-tence of ghosts as a negative mental problem of ao tuong (‘‘illusory think-ing’’) in a similar way to how John Law projected it, but these are greatly outnumbered by those who instead consider it as part of the nature of being and becoming in the world, that is, as an ontological question. Ghosts are called various terms (ma, hon, hon ma, bong ma, linh hon, oan hon, bach linh), translated in literature typically as ‘‘lost souls’’ or ‘‘wan-dering souls,’’ but in popular ritual idiom, co bac. The term co bac is an interpersonal reference meaning ‘‘aunts and uncles,’’ which, in ritual context, is contrasted to the term ong ba (‘‘grandfathers and grand-mothers’’) that is used to address ancestors and gods worshiped in private homes or inside a communal temple. These ‘‘aunts and uncles’’ are dead, but not really dead in the sense of being settled in the am (the world of the dead); they are not alive, but they still have not left the world of the living. They are neither really there in the world of the dead (am) nor here in this world (duong), and, at once, are in both. The idea of ‘‘wandering’’ in terms of wandering spirits points to the imagined situation that these spirits are obliged to move between the periphery of this world and the fringe of another world. In short, ghosts are a kind of ontological refugees, close to the status of Ernest Bloch’s das unheimlich, who are uprooted from home, which is to them a place where their memory can be settled.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Someone’s real-life encounter with these uprooted, placeless beings does not necessarily raise a question of credulity among his neighbors and instead would generate intense curiosity on the specific identity of the spirit and the practical implications of the apparition. Ghosts are believed to have wishes and purposes of their own kind, and they partake in the community life with their own particular vitalities. The spirits of the dead desire, in the mind of the living, the goods and facilities that living people require for their living: food and money, clothing and shoes, and some-times, a house and a bicycle or Honda. The goods offered to the spirits may include a traveler’s bag, if the spirit happens to have been an inter-city retailer during her former life. Sharing wealth and worldly pleasures constitutes popular practice, the primary relationship between humans and spirits. Transaction of goods and services between the dead and the living, in turn, contributes to making the spirits appear more familiar and human-like. This is the case irrespective of whether the recipients are ancestral identities worshiped at home or placeless anonymous ghosts imagined to wander in the outside.

                    Ghosts in Vietnam are also very much public figures. Most private encounters with them inevitably develop into varying forms of social commemoration. Putting incense sticks on the site of the apparition is already a demonstratively public gesture, for as soon as this takes place, the place transforms into a site of consolation. The story of the apparition and its further historical background will also travel quickly in the area to become public knowledge. No one, except an outsider, will walk care-lessly on this place. Each time villagers walk by the site, the incense sticks and the lump of ash force them to recall the story and think about that particular apparition. This may last a few months, or a few years, until the story is resigned to oblivion and the site reverts to being an uncharacter-istic ditch. The acknowledgement can vary from incense burning to food and money offering, and at times to a full-scale spirit-consolation cere-mony superceded by a ritual specialist. In proportion to the intensity of acknowledgement, the ghost becomes an increasingly integral part of the local history.

                    The residents in Cam Re occasionally strived to push away some excessively troublesome ghosts from their environment, and these included, during my stay, what people believed to be the ghost of an Algerian conscript from the time of the French War. The local ritual specialist thay phu thuy hired for this evacuation walked along the ditch reciting an incantation (cau chu) where the Algerian ghost was believed to frequent, and later there was a widely circulated rumor that the foreign ghost, which had the naughty habit of touching the shoulder of young women from behind their back, ran away in panic, in fear of the incanta-tion. The Cam Re people were also aware that ghosts of war, in the vicissitude of their existence, might occasionally intrude into the body of a living person and cause critical conditions. Some ghosts, however, had recently transformed to become important communal deities of considerable power and exercised their power to heal these spirit-caused illnesses or for other purposes. In between these two possibilities and realities, the Cam Re residents related to ghosts as part of the order of their everyday life. The living must not kick away ghosts at the door, the ritual specialist once told me, for it is this inhospitality that often triggers the ghost’s intrusive actions into the interior space. Yet, people did not invite them into their domestic interior either, for this would confuse them with the ancestors and gods worshiped at home. It appeared that ghosts in this place were entitled to the right to exist in the social world of the living, and that local ritual practices consisted of constant negotia-tions over social and ecological space with the ontologically given, socially distinct group of beings.
