Because in Vietnamese perspective, they see the American as the enemy of country, a evil capitalist forces from the West coming to colonize the country.

                        <!-- Vietnamese did not to some extent see this as a civil war, supported by the United States. They consider that much of the losses and damages was caused by the American forces and much of what is happening was enforced and guided by the US Millitary. Therefore, to them, Vietnamese from the South are only "puppets" controlled by the American. And all Vietnamese people did not really have a saying in choosing sides in this conflict, the country was splitted because of the conflict against Western forces, not against each other-->
                        <span class="highlight" id="three">‘‘The Vietnam war, in short, was a civil war, but - and this may puzzle Vietnamese, who are currently discovering the extent to which it was a civil war for them - it was an American civil war.’’</span> 
                        
                        The radical division of a nation as to the objective and the conduct of a war that it is drawn to fight, as Powell notes, has a lot to do with how the memory of this war turns into a ‘‘collective phan-tom.’’Young states, <br>
                        <span id="quotation">More divisive than any conflict Americans have engaged in since the Civil War, the Vietnam war raised questions about the nation’s very identity. These questions have not been settled. The battle over interpreting the Vietnam war is a battle over interpreting America and it continues to the present day.</span>

                        <br>
                        According to another observer, the war was waged ‘‘not only on a distant battlefield, but also ‘in the uncharted depths of the American psyche and in the obscurity of our nation’s soul’. ’’ <span class="highlight" id="four">Young points out also that the Vietnamese, a generation after the war formally ended, are now discovering the hitherto unspoken dimension of what has been, in the official discourse, an unambiguous, uncontested struggle of the unified nation against foreign aggression.</span> Following Young, we will see in the following chapters how the recovered civil war dimension of the American War generates an array of interpretative controversies at community level and how these controversies structure some of the ghost narratives told within the community.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The phenomenon of war ghosts is intimately connected, in both Vietnam and America, with the troubled memory of the war. On this matter, Young’s idea that the Vietnam War and the American War were both partly a civil war is worth careful consideration. 
                        <!-- Animated visualization showing the number of loss https://www.britannica.com/question/How-many-people-died-in-the-Vietnam-War -->
                        <span class="highlight" id="five">One must not forget, however, the fact that death in this doubly civil war took place mainly in the land of Vietnam and that it is the Vietnamese who count the vast majority in the list of the war dead.</span> 
                        This simple truth must have some relevance in the stories of war ghosts told in Vietnam and in their being distinct from the idiom of ghost mentioned in American public media. France experienced a proliferation of war ghost narratives in the after-math of the First World War, according to the historian Jay Winter in his moving work on the role of ghost beliefs in mass grieving, but the nation’s foreign military ventures in Algeria or Indochina have never produced any remotely comparable corpus of stories in France. It is rather in Vietnam, not in France, that some of France’s ancients combat-tants are still half-alive today in the form of a giant, uniformed ghost or in other less intimidating forms of spectral existence. Some of these old ghosts appear in company with those of other racial origins from the time of the French War, whom the locals identity as the colonial con-scripts from Algeria or Morocco. This finding applies to American history too. Of the several wars America fought for self-defense or in defense of other nations, no history of war can compete with that of the American Civil War in terms of contribution to the American folkloric and literary tradition of ghost stories. War in my home and war in their home seem to be two quite different historical grounds for this particular genre of cultural production.

                        Death in Vietnam was mainly the death of a soldier in American memory, as evidenced by the central material symbol of this collective memory – the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Arlington, Virginia. 
                        <!-- https://vietnamtheartofwar.com/2019/01/10/nguyen-thanh-minh-gallery-2/ --  https://vietnamtheartofwar.com/2019/01/09/vo-xuong-gallery/-->
                        Death in the American War was also mainly that of a combatant according to official Vietnamese memorial art. This is materialized in the numerous cemeteries and cenotaphs distributed widely throughout Vietnam that can be easily seen in any rural village or town district.
                        <!-- https://thediplomat.com/2022/10/vietnamese-war-victims-struggle-for-justice-a-tale-of-two-lawsuits/ -->
                        <span class="highlight" id="six"> In reality, however, death in the Vietnam–American War was virtually anyone’s death for the Vietnamese – young and old, male and female, combatant or non-combatant, partisan or non-partisan, or communist or anticommunist.</span> This was particularly the case in the southern and central regions of Vietnam where the frontiers of battlefield were abominably unclear.

                        The war against America was theoretically a <span class="highlight" id="seven">‘‘people’s war.’’</span> It aimed to consolidate the army with the people, the soldiers in combat uniforms with the patriotic citizens without uniform, and the combat units with the rural villages. <span class="highlight" id="eight">The army was the fish, according to a powerful metaphor of the Vietnamese revolutionary war, and the people were the water where the fish would live.</span>  In many villages of southern and central Vietnam, the unity of army and people was far more complex and turbulent than the idyllic image of fish swimming peacefully in the landscaped pond of a middle-class Vietnamese town house. As the conflict escalated, the ‘‘water’’ was systematically pumped out to expose the ‘‘fish.’’ Often, no ‘‘fish’’ were found in the bottom of the pond, and this frequently led to tragic incidents of civilian killing. The dislocated water of people could not survive away from their ancestral land and was also pushed back to their place of origin to harbor the fish of army. The agit-prop activity to encourage war refugees to return to their homeland was intense through-out the refugee camps and strategic hamlets in southern and central Vietnam.   As a former highlands tribal leader said, ‘‘We were between the hammer and anvil. The Communists tried to resettle us ... The Americans wanted to get free fire zones with the Montagnards.’’Moving hazardously between the rural homeland and the refugee camp or the urban slum, people in the people’s war left numerous traces of loss and trails of sorrow.<span class="highlight" id="nine"> Today, shallow graves and collective tombs remain in the sand dune, along the village footpath, and in the household garden; unknown human remains are discovered underneath the mud floor of the house. </span> Some of these improperly buried dead belonged to the revolutionary side, others to the opposite side, and many more to both-and-neither sides. Some of them would belong to soldiers, but these are greatly outnumbered by the remains of the dead who had no war-related pro-fessional backgrounds.

                        It is in this historical landscape of generalized violence and mass dis-placement that people perceive today the presence of grievous ghosts of war. The destruction of war constitutes the backdrop or what archeol-ogists call ‘‘the contemporary past’’ for the phenomenon of war ghosts. Against the background of a mass-mobilized total war with heavy foreign intervention, war ghosts in Vietnam are highly diverse in origin and sometimes have a cosmopolitan outlook. In his short story ‘‘The billion dollar skeleton,’’ Phan Huy Dong lists, ‘‘men women children old people Viets Laos Khmers Thais Koreans Australians New Zealanders French black white red yellow brown ... even a few Americans.’’ <span class="highlight" id="ten"> Many Vietnamese regularly burn incense and pray on behalf of these heteroge-neous beings, and these people are from all walks of life; many with the biographical background of marching in ‘‘the trail of revolution’’ (duong cach mang). Those who refuse to acknowledge the existence of sorrowful war ghosts in the old fields of mass death are sometimes mocked and subtly criticized – subtly because many of these non-conformists tend to be in positions of power in the Communist Party and other key political organizations. </span>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        These heterogeneous ghosts of war do not constitute a ‘‘collective phantom.’’ They are not merely an allegorical device for historical anal-ogy, invoked to deliver the meaning of a new historical event against the similar or contrasting background of a familiar old one. Nor do they merely point to the paradox in modern historical consciousness, addressed by Schmitt, that a dead era appears to walk in the new era at a time of crisis and especially if the new era nurtures an ideology of radical break with the old. This paradox is deeply engrained in the tradition of modern social thought. Karl Marx wrote bitterly in The eighteenth brum-aire of the ghost of dead generations exercising its invisible hands in the social revolution and thereby distorting its course, whereas Max Weber wrote The protestant ethic in terms of how the tradition of medieval monastic asceticism prowls the culture of modern capitalist economic order. Drawing upon this intellectual legacy, Mark Schneider argues that apparitions persist in the modern world despite the rise of science, and that their enduring existence is often unrecognized in modern societies because its domain of existence has changed from the natural to the symbolic.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ghosts in Vietnam are not ‘‘modern’’ in the above sense and in that their existence is perceived to be a ‘‘natural’’ phenomenon rather than a cultural symbol. There are people in Vietnam who would view the existence of ghosts as a negative mental problem of ao tuong (‘‘illusory think-ing’’) in a similar way to how John Law projected it, but these are greatly outnumbered by those who instead consider it as part of the nature of being and becoming in the world, that is, as an ontological question. <span class="highlight" id="eleven"> Ghosts are called various terms (ma, hon, hon ma, bong ma, linh hon, oan hon, bach linh), translated in literature typically as ‘‘lost souls’’ or ‘‘wan-dering souls,’’ but in popular ritual idiom, co bac. The term co bac is an interpersonal reference meaning ‘‘aunts and uncles,’’ which, in ritual context, is contrasted to the term ong ba (‘‘grandfathers and grand-mothers’’) that is used to address ancestors and gods worshiped in private homes or inside a communal temple.</span> These ‘‘aunts and uncles’’ are dead, but not really dead in the sense of being settled in the am (the world of the dead); they are not alive, but they still have not left the world of the living. They are neither really there in the world of the dead (am) nor here in this world (duong), and, at once, are in both. The idea of ‘‘wandering’’ in terms of wandering spirits points to the imagined situation that these spirits are obliged to move between the periphery of this world and the fringe of another world. In short, ghosts are a kind of ontological refugees, close to the status of Ernest Bloch’s das unheimlich, who are uprooted from home, which is to them a place where their memory can be settled.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Someone’s real-life encounter with these uprooted, placeless beings does not necessarily raise a question of credulity among his neighbors and instead would generate intense curiosity on the specific identity of the spirit and the practical implications of the apparition. <span class="highlight" id="thirteen"> Ghosts are believed to have wishes and purposes of their own kind, and they partake in the community life with their own particular vitalities.</span> The spirits of the dead desire, in the mind of the living, the goods and facilities that living people require for their living: food and money, clothing and shoes, and some-times, a house and a bicycle or Honda. The goods offered to the spirits may include a traveler’s bag, if the spirit happens to have been an inter-city retailer during her former life. Sharing wealth and worldly pleasures constitutes popular practice, the primary relationship between humans and spirits. Transaction of goods and services between the dead and the living, in turn, contributes to making the spirits appear more familiar and human-like. This is the case irrespective of whether the recipients are ancestral identities worshiped at home or placeless anonymous ghosts imagined to wander in the outside.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ghosts in Vietnam are also very much public figures. Most private encounters with them inevitably develop into varying forms of social commemoration. Putting incense sticks on the site of the apparition is already a demonstratively public gesture, for as soon as this takes place, the place transforms into a site of consolation. The story of the apparition and its further historical background will also travel quickly in the area to become public knowledge. No one, except an outsider, will walk care-lessly on this place. Each time villagers walk by the site, the incense sticks and the lump of ash force them to recall the story and think about that particular apparition. This may last a few months, or a few years, until the story is resigned to oblivion and the site reverts to being an uncharacteristic ditch. The acknowledgement can vary from incense burning to food and money offering, and at times to a full-scale spirit-consolation ceremony superceded by a ritual specialist.
                        <!-- Not only ghosts but stories of deities, family gods or goddesses, ancestorial members boomed after the economics and social reforms made after the 1990s. Folk religions, superstitious practices gain back its role a an integral part of Vietnamese culture. -->
                        <span class="highlight" id="fourteen">In proportion to the intensity of acknowledgement, the ghost becomes an increasingly integral part of the local history.</span>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The residents in Cam Re occasionally strived to push away some excessively troublesome ghosts from their environment, and these included, during my stay, what people believed to be the ghost of an Algerian conscript from the time of the French War. The local ritual specialist thay phu thuy hired for this evacuation walked along the ditch reciting an incantation (cau chu) where the Algerian ghost was believed to frequent, and later there was a widely circulated rumor that the foreign ghost, which had the naughty habit of touching the shoulder of young women from behind their back, ran away in panic, in fear of the incanta-tion. The Cam Re people were also aware that ghosts of war, in the vicissitude of their existence, might occasionally intrude into the body of a living person and cause critical conditions. Some ghosts, however, had recently transformed to become important communal deities of considerable power and exercised their power to heal these spirit-caused illnesses or for other purposes. In between these two possibilities and realities, the Cam Re residents related to ghosts as part of the order of their everyday life. The living must not kick away ghosts at the door, the ritual specialist once told me, for it is this inhospitality that often triggers the ghost’s intrusive actions into the interior space. Yet, people did not invite them into their domestic interior either, for this would confuse them with the ancestors and gods worshiped at home. It appeared that ghosts in this place were entitled to the right to exist in the social world of the living, and that local ritual practices consisted of constant negotiations over social and ecological space with the ontologically given, socially distinct group of beings.
                        <br> 
                        <br>

                        The identity of ghosts within this ‘‘naturalist’’ milieu of existence, to
                        quote Claude Lévi-Strauss, is not the same as that of their modern,
                        symbolic counterpart - the menacing collective phantom of the past that
                        makes the living feel conquered by it unless they are able to conquer it.
                        However, this differentiation should not be taken to mean that ghost beliefs
                        in Vietnam represent some kind of pre-conceptual magical thought, such
                        as that imagined by Lucien Lévy-Bruhl, dominated by the fear of death and
                        unaware of the differences between the real and the imaginary. On the
                        contrary, ghosts as a thing out there, unrelated and oblivious to what the
                        living imagine for them, are as unfamiliar in Vietnam as elsewhere.

                        <br> 
                        <br>
                        
                        <span class="highlight" id="fifteen">The Vietnamese discourses about spirits and ghosts are rich with
                        critical historical meanings, and they gain currency precisely because
                        they are able to relate to pressing moral and political issues in contemporary life. </span>The phenomenon of war ghosts, in other words, is not outside
                        history but rather reflects on the historically constituted human condition,
                        sometimes in close affinity with what may be described as <span class="highlight" id="sixteen"> Hegelian
                        zeitgeist – the anticipatory spirit of the historical epoch </span> (see chapter 2). 
                        <span class="highlight" id="seventeen">For example, the apparition of the party official’s brother mentioned
                        above acted upon the absence of his memory in the domain of kinship,
                        and this relates to the legacy of a civil war/cold war, concealed and
                        unaccounted-for in the official paradigm of a unified ‘‘people’s war’’
                        against a common, foreign enemy. The episode of the spirit family was
                        mainly a family affair, but this is also inseparable from the wider social
                        issues such as the disparity between the huge sacrifice of unarmed civilians
                        to the war and the indifference of the structure of power to their
                        memory.</span> This group of mother and children spirits may appear to be
                        closer to the category of ancestors than to that of ghosts, for their deaths
                        are remembered by the surviving member of the family. For complex
                        reasons I have explained elsewhere, however, the victims of an extreme
                        event such as a village massacre and the dead whose death disrupts the family’s genealogical order have many problems to overcome in order to
                        be accepted as categorical ancestors.<span class="highlight" id="eighteen"> Moreover, the difficulties have
                        been exacerbated by the state’s intrusive cultural policy that transformed
                        the domestic ritual space into a memorial for heroic war death.</span> In these
                        contexts, the individual apparitions of the dead are reflections on (and
                        reminders of) the predicaments in the collective memory of the living. If the
                        living enact on the apparitions and proceed to change their social and ritual
                        space to a more accountable form, which these incidents typically develop
                        into, the fantastical actions of spectral identities become interwoven with
                        the transformation in the material world, and the stories about them are no
                        longer ‘‘just a story,’’ as Sherry Ortner points out with reference to Sherpa
                        religious history in the Himalayas, but part of the social action and take on
                        the structuring force of the patterns of social life.
                        <br> 
                        <br>
                        The last is an important point for the orientation of the following
                        chapters, one of whose consistent aims is to elicit how people assert their
                        moral and political identities through the imaginary actions of war ghosts.
                        In order to understand how ghosts and humans become partners in social
                        action, however, we need first to come to terms with the conceptual
                        structure that separates the two in the first place.<span class="highlight" id="nineteen"> Ghosts in Vietnam are
                        supposed to be attentive to the social affairs in the living world, just as the
                        latter are fond of telling stories about their existence.</span> This relationship of
                        reciprocal attention assumes not only an existential proximity between the

                    <p>The American War is an abbreviation of "The Vietnamese resistance war against the American forces" - a common name Vietnamese people are familiar with to describe the war. Because in Vietnamese perspective, they see the American as the enemy of country, a evil capitalist forces from the West coming to colonize the country. Similar names applied to the Vietnamese war against other colonial forces like the French in the 19th - first halft of 20th century , the Han Dynasty in 111BC, etc. Vietnam War was the way most Western media and politicians use for its "objective narrative".

                    <p>Vietnamese did not, a large extent, see this as a civil war, supported by the United States. They consider that much of the losses and damages was caused by the American forces and much of what is happening was instigated, enforced and guided by the US Millitary. Therefore, to them, Vietnamese authority from the South were only "puppets" controlled by the US Military. And all Vietnamese people did not want to choose sides in this conflict, all they wanted was unification and freedom for their country. Vietnam was splitted because the U.S intervened in the process of reunification after Vietnam 1945's Independence from the French colonialism.<br>

                        This is a popular metaphor made by the Communist leader Ho Chi Minh.
                        The phrase was a way for him to say that the people is where the power lies. They are the livelihood, the means for survival like that between water and fish. So the army, the government, the soldiers have to help each others and help common people in order to survive together against foreign intruders. Vietnamese soldiers on both sides sometimes live within villages 
                        to hide from their "enemy" with the help of the people. Knowing this, the both sides tend to drop bombs and fires at villagers just to weed out all possibilities of them allying with the enemy"

This stems from the idea of the wandering soul, the idea of a good or bad death. A good death involves having a lot of surviving children, dying quickly and painlessly and having one’s body whole. These things are important because they help the soul make its way to the otherworld. When a person dies his soul hangs around the corpse for a while, unaware that the body is dead. If it has died peacefully and is in a familiar place then it stays quietly there until the family begins the rituals necessary to assist the soul through to the other world. If the rites are done correctly and the circumstances are right, the soul will enter the other world and become a beneficent ancestor. He will look after the family, provided the family looks after him by doing the yearly ritual of "dam gio", the feast on the anniversary of the death.</a></p>

                        Vietnames people's beliefs in folk religions and ghost stories can also simply be seen as similar to how Westerners or any religious people finding comfort and some grounds for their own sufferings and desires. And for Vietnamese, a collective grief can also found through their ghost stories, mostly word-of-mouth about the people who did not make it through the war but also the history and the culture that got lost because of it. Folk religion gain their popularity was not only a response to the current state of affair but also a method of coping through the past and setting their hope the future.

The practice of sending prayers, building tombs, performing rituals for the death are part of the Vietnamese identity, especially when dealing with grieves. But there is always a line between cultural superstition practices and oversuperstition, the latter is where not only the government but also most Vietnamese would see them as unnecessary and easy to taken advantage of.</p>

It is believed that sometime during the first half of the month, the gate of hell is open and the ghosts from the Lower Realm will roam free on Earth. The ancestors and the deceased relatives will find their way back to visit living descendants. Other so-called "lost ghosts", which have no home and hear no prayers, will wander around, lost, lonely and bitter. The ancestors find their way back by tracing back the offerings and prayers of children, and upon feasting will bless them with good luck. Meanwhile lost ghosts, the ones with no relatives, forgotten by descendants or those who died without proper burial have nothing offered to them and will angrily curse bad luck upon strangers.</a></quotation>  </p>

Apart from all the souls left wandering the face of the earth after the war, many people die violently and away from home. It is imperative that the body is repatriated to the family home as soon as possible so the rituals can begin. If not, the soul wanders around and if it feels like it, enters the body of some unsuspecting person.</a></p>
