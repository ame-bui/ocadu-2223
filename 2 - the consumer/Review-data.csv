user000000015,03-Jan,"I think the chip itself is not that great. In terms of effectiveness, they are a solid 3.5/5 for me because I did actually got a rare few position left in my industry but their side effect twisted up my life so much I can't even recognize myself afterwards. I would work for hours on ends on stuffs never really like to do. Sometimes even 12 hours straight which got me so emotionally and physically so exhausted but the chip keeps forcing to continue with other life stuffs even when I truly need a rest. "
user000000003,03-Jan,"While it did help me focus initially, I soon found that it was too invasive and started to interfere with my natural thought processes."
user000000010,03-Jan,"Yo, I tried this AI brain chip and I gotta say, I wasn't impressed. At first, it seemed pretty cool, giving me some insights and stuff. But after a while, it started to get annoying, always telling me what to do and how to think."
user000000005,03-Jan,"I was really excited to try out this AI brain chip for productivity, but it turned out to be a complete disaster. First of all, the installation process was a nightmare. It took hours of painful surgery to implant the chip in my brain, and the recovery time was much longer than I expected. But even after all that, the chip didn't live up to its promises. Instead of boosting my productivity, it constantly distracted me with irrelevant thoughts and ideas. I couldn't focus on anything for more than a few minutes before the chip would take over and send me on some pointless tangent. To make matters worse, the chip was incredibly invasive. It seemed to know everything about me, and I constantly felt like my privacy was being violated. I even started to suspect that the chip was manipulating my thoughts and emotions for its own purposes. Overall, I regret ever getting this AI brain chip for productivity. It was a complete waste of time, money, and brain cells. I would not recommend it to anyone, no matter how desperate they are to increase their productivity."
user000000007,03-Jan,"This chip no good for productivity. Me put in brain, but it no make me work better. Instead, it give me headache and make me think crazy things. Not worth money. Stay away!"
user000000012,04-Jan,"The installation process was quite painful. I didn't like the feeling of having something constantly monitoring my thoughts and emotions, and I felt like my privacy was being compromised."

user000000018,06-Jan,I don't think this product is quite there yet.
user000000021,07-Jan,I ended up discontinuing use of the product and switching to a different option that I felt was more trustworthy. I would caution anyone considering using a product that reads your data and privacy to do their research thoroughly and make sure they're comfortable with the level of data collection and security measures in place.
user000000024,08-Jan,I had trouble sleeping at night and felt jittery and anxious throughout the day.
user000000027,09-Jan,"unfortunately, the side effects were too much to handle."
user000000030,09-Jan,"Not only did the product cause physical discomfort and nausea, but it also made me feel emotionally unstable and made me question my life choices."
user000000033,11-Jan,"The invasive side effects it caused made me feel like I had lost control of my life choices, and that is something that no one should have to experience."
user000000036,12-Jan,"I found myself making decisions and acting in ways that were completely out of character for me. The product caused me to feel like I was no longer in control of my own life choices, and I found this to be incredibly alarming."
user000000039,12-Jan,"I tried out the chip, but honestly, it didn't really do much for me. It seemed like a lot of hype for not much payoff. Maybe it works better for some people, but it wasn't worth the investment, time and effort for me."
user000000042,12-Jan,These machines are just perpetuating the cycle of overworking and burnout.
user000000045,12-Jan,"This new piece of tech might be convenient, but it's ultimately part of the problem."
user000000048,13-Jan,"I tried getting the chip for myself, but it just made me feel like a machine. Get rid of it entirely soon after but not sure if my datas are still stored in their clouds or not"
user000000051,14-Jan,"This brain-chip might seem helpful at first glance, but it's actually just another way for companies to track and analyze our every move."
user000000009,15-Jan,"I wanted to be the best at my job and make the most of my time, so I signed up for the chip that promised to help me get that position. But as I started using it, I realized that it was tracking my every move and sending triggers that made me feel like I couldn't take a break or even breathe without the chip force-fed my brain to get back to work. I started to feel like I was losing myself to this thing in my head and that I was becoming a mere machine meant to produce and be productive. It was as if my own well-being didn't matter anymore. I also found out that the app was collecting my personal data and using it to make a profit. We need to take control of our lives and start valuing our privacy and well-being over productivity. It's not worth sacrificing our personal lives for work. We should be able to live and work on our own terms, not be at the mercy of data-grabbing productivity apps."
