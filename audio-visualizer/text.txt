At dusk we drove, 
Calling the wind, and calling you,
Halfway dreaming,
What's that song you're humming?,
What's on your mind?,
Watching the sunset in the rearview mirror,
Feeling kinda happy, feeling kinda lonely,
Seems like I've been done in by my cold medicine,
And like that, in that mood, I'm…,
I'm driving, driving, driving, driving…,
What's that song you're humming?,
What's on your mind?,
Get 'round in the season,
Get 'round in the season,
You might also like,
Get 'round in the season,
Get 'round in the season,
Get 'round in the season,

Get 'round in the season,

We were halfway dreaming,

We were halfway dreaming,

Halfway dreaming...,
At dusk we drove,

Calling the wind, and calling you,

Driving from one end of Tokyo to the other,

Halfway dreaming,

Dreaming...
